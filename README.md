The `assets` folder of this repository contains the output plots from various code cells, particularly for Question 15. This allows the images to be embedded in markdown cells, which allows for easier formatting and readability. When viewing a notebook, the assets folder must be in the same directory as the notebook, otherwise the plots will not render properly in the markdown.
